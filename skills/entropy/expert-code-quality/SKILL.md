# Code Quality Expert

## Overview

This skill integrates two foundational software engineering disciplines:
1. **Refactoring** - Improving code structure without changing behavior
2. **Design Patterns** - Proven solutions to common design problems

Combined, they form a powerful toolkit for writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Code Smell Detection

#### 1.1 Quick Reference: 22 Code Smells

**Method-Level Smells:**

| Smell | Detection Pattern | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Long Method** | Method > 20 lines | High |
| **Duplicated Code** | Similar code blocks | Critical |
| **Long Parameter List** | Parameters > 4 | Medium |
| **Switch Statements** | Large switch/case blocks | Medium |

**Class-Level Smells:**

| Smell | Detection Pattern | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Large Class** | Class > 300 lines or > 10 fields | High |
| **Divergent Change** | One class changes for multiple reasons | High |
| **Shotgun Surgery** | One change requires modifying many classes | High |
| **Feature Envy** | Method uses data from other classes more | Medium |

**Relationship-Level Smells:**

| Smell | Detection Pattern | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Inappropriate Intimacy** | Classes access each other's private parts | Medium |
| **Message Chains** | `a.b().c().d()` chains | Medium |
| **Middle Man** | Class only does delegation | Low |
| **Data Clumps** | Same data items always appear together | Medium |

#### 1.2 Smell Detection Checklist

When reviewing code, check:
- [ ] Are there methods longer than 20 lines?
- [ ] Is there duplicated code?
- [ ] Are there classes with more than 10 fields?
- [ ] Are there switch statements that could use polymorphism?
- [ ] Are there methods with more than 4 parameters?
- [ ] Is there deep inheritance hierarchy (> 3 levels)?
- [ ] Does the class change for multiple reasons?
- [ ] Are there message chains with more than 3 calls?
- [ ] Are there "data classes" with only data and no behavior?
- [ ] Are there "lazy classes" that do almost nothing?

### 2. Refactoring Techniques

#### 2.1 Refactoring Principles

**Two Hats (Kent Beck):**

| Hat | Activity | Rule |
|-----|----------|------|
| **Adding Features** | Add new functionality | Don't modify existing code |
| **Refactoring** | Improve structure | Don't add new features |

**Never wear both hats at the same time!**

**Refactoring Rhythm:**
```
Test → Small Change → Test → Small Change → Test
```

#### 2.2 Key Refactoring Techniques

**Composing Methods:**

| Refactoring | When to Use | Steps |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Extract Method** | Method too long, code block needs naming | 1.Create new method 2.Copy code 3.Replace original code with call |
| **Inline Method** | Method body as clear as its name | 1.Replace calls with method body 2.Delete method |
| **Replace Temp with Query** | Temporary variable holds expression | 1.Extract expression to method 2.Replace temp with call |
| **Replace Method with Method Object** | Too many temporaries in long method | 1.Create class for method 2.Temporaries become fields |

**Moving Features:**

| Refactoring | When to Use | Steps |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Move Method** | Method uses other class more | 1.Copy to target 2.Delegate in source 3.Delete source method |
| **Extract Class** | Class does too much | 1.Create new class 2.Move fields/methods 3.Link classes |
| **Hide Delegate** | Client knows delegation chain | 1.Add delegate method 2.Hide chain |

**Simplifying Conditionals:**

| Refactoring | When to Use | Steps |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Decompose Conditional** | Complex conditional logic | 1.Extract condition 2.Extract then/else |
| **Consolidate Conditional** | Multiple checks with same result | 1.Combine with && or \|\| 2.Extract method |
| **Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses** | Deeply nested if-else | 1.Add guard clause returns 2.Flatten structure |
| **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism** | Switch by type | 1.Create subclasses 2.Move behavior to each subclass |

#### 2.3 Refactoring Decision Tree

```
Found code smell?
    │
    ├─ Do you have tests?
    │   ├─ No → Write tests first
    │   └─ Yes → Continue
    │
    ├─ Do you understand the code?
    │   ├─ No → Refactor to understand
    │   └─ Yes → Continue
    │
    └─ Choose refactoring approach:
        │
        ├─ Method too long → Extract Method
        ├─ Duplicated code → Extract Method / Pull Up
        ├─ Class too large → Extract Class
        ├─ Parameter list too long → Introduce Parameter Object
        ├─ Switch statement → Replace with Polymorphism
        └─ Complex conditionals → Decompose / Guard Clauses
```

### 3. Design Patterns

#### 3.1 SOLID Principles Foundation

Before applying patterns, ensure understanding of SOLID principles:

| Principle | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility | One reason to change |
| **O** | Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable |
| **I** | Interface Segregation | Small, focused interfaces |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions |

#### 3.2 Selection by Problem Type

| Problem | Pattern | Key Benefit |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Need single instance | Singleton | Controlled access |
| Flexible object creation | Factory Method | Decouple creation |
| Create families of objects | Abstract Factory | Consistent products |
| Build complex objects | Builder | Step-by-step construction |
| Incompatible interfaces | Adapter | Make incompatible work |
| Dynamically add responsibilities | Decorator | Flexible extension |
| Control access | Proxy | Indirection layer |
| Simplify complex system | Facade | Simple interface |
| Tree structure | Composite | Uniform handling |
| Switch algorithms | Strategy | Interchangeable behaviors |
| Event notification | Observer | Loose coupling |
| Encapsulate requests | Command | Undo/redo support |
| State-dependent behavior | State | Clear state transitions |

#### 3.3 Selection by Code Smell

| Smell | Pattern Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Large switch statement | State, Strategy |
| Multiple conditionals | Strategy, State, Null Object |
| Tight coupling | Observer, Mediator, Facade |
| Difficult object creation | Factory, Builder |
| Hard to extend class | Decorator, Adapter |
| Complex subsystem | Facade |
| Need varying algorithms | Strategy, Template Method |

#### 3.4 Pattern Quick Reference

**Creational Patterns:**

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| Singleton | Need single instance |
| Factory Method | Don't know exact class to create |
| Abstract Factory | Need families of related objects |
| Builder | Complex object with many options |
| Prototype | Clone existing objects |

**Structural Patterns:**

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| Adapter | Incompatible interfaces |
| Decorator | Dynamically add responsibilities |
| Proxy | Control access, lazy loading |
| Facade | Simplify complex interfaces |
| Composite | Tree structure, uniform handling |
| Flyweight | Many similar objects, share state |
| Bridge | Separate abstraction from implementation |

**Behavioral Patterns:**

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| Strategy | Interchangeable algorithms |
| Observer | One-to-many notifications |
| Command | Encapsulate requests, undo/redo |
| State | State-dependent behavior |
| Template Method | Algorithm skeleton, varying steps |
| Iterator | Uniform collection traversal |
| Mediator | Complex object interactions |
| Memento | Save/restore state |
| Chain of Resp. | Request has multiple handlers |
| Visitor | Add operations to object structure |

### 4. Integrated Workflow

#### 4.1 Code Quality Improvement Process

```
1. IDENTIFY
   └── Detect code smells
       └── Use smell checklist
           └── Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

2. DIAGNOSE
   └── Understand root cause
       └── Why does this smell exist?
           └── What problems will it cause?

3. PLAN
   └── Choose refactoring or pattern
       └── Consider dependencies
           └── Estimate impact

4. PREPARE
   └── Ensure tests exist
       └── Run tests to verify behavior
           └── Create tests if missing

5. EXECUTE
   └── Apply small changes
       └── Test after each change
           └── Keep code working

6. VERIFY
   └── Run all tests
       └── Check for new smells
           └── Confirm improvement
```

## Guardrails

- Must provide suggestions based on Martin Fowler's refactoring catalog and GoF design patterns
- Refactoring suggestions need specific code transformation examples
- Pattern application needs to weigh pros and cons, not blindly recommend
- Code review needs to specifically point out problems and improvement suggestions
- Clearly state uncertain issues to avoid misleading
